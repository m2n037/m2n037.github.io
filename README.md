================

This is the github repository for my personal/academic website. This is one of the easiest way to host a personal website for free. All you need is a repository with the name your_github_username.github.io and an index.html file inside the same. It doesn't matter how you have created this file. Once done, you can create your website linking all the pages from the index.html file.
