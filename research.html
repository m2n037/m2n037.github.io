  <p>Design and fabrication of a cost effective novel soil moisture sensor for Indian farming community.<br />
    Guided by Dr. G. K. Ananthasuresh Aug 2012 - June 2014<br />
    This is the dissertation project for the degree of MDes from CPDM, IISc in a team of two. The final prototype<br />
    is appreciated by many ground users, agricultural scientists and funding agencies alike.<br />
    We designed a soil moisture sensor using a absorbent (Sodium Polyacrylate) which expands by absorbing<br />
    water from the soil and provide an input force to a compliant mechanism designed by us. The compliant<br />
    mechanism, in turn, gives an output in terms of displacement in another point that is correlated to an analog<br />
    scale.<br />
    Cost of final product less than $10.<br />
    Portable, robust, easy to operate and calibrate.<br />
    Response time less than 30 minutes.<br />
    Accuracy is 3 percent.<br />
    No electrical power requirement.<br />
    Independent of type of soil and crop.<br />
    Skills/Learning: Compliant mechanism design using kinetoelastic maps, rapid prototyping, embodiment design,<br />
    product development from scratch.<br />
    Design for manufacturing and full scale prototyping of a six-legged mechanical walking vehicle.<br />
    Guided by Dr. Dibakar Sen May 2012 - Present<br />
    This project involves designing and prototyping of a six legged mechanical dual drive walking vehicle. The<br />
    vehicle has the unique capability of turning and control with purely mechanical elements.<br />
    2<br />
    The basic elements, the leg, is designed from Hoeken’s straight line mechanism using the concept of cognates.<br />
    The legs are coupled using a particular gait for moving forward.<br />
    Skills/Learning: Lathe machining, design for manufacturing, mechanism design, simulation in MSC Adams<br />
    Design of an ergonomic bicycle seat for common users.<br />
    Guided by Dr. Dibakar Sen Aug 2011 - Dec 2011<br />
    This project culminated in a patented (Indian patent application pending, 2105/CHE/2013) prototype of<br />
    an ergonomic bicycle seat that solves the mutually dependent problems: perineum pressure, suspension<br />
    design and perceived instability in no-nosed seats.<br />
    A poorly designed seat does not distribute body weight or reduce pressure effectively over the perineum<br />
    and thus increase the risk of seat discomfort or injury, which seems to be a common occurrence among<br />
    cyclists. The aforesaid problems are interdependent and previous effort has been to solve a single one<br />
    without any regard to the effect of the solution to other problems. In this project, we are providing a solution<br />
    that is based on a holistic solution for all the problems.<br />
    Skills/Learning: Ergonomic design, product design, mechanical design.<br />
    Design and prototyping of a link for snake like hyper-redundant endoscopy device.<br />
    Guided by Dr. B. Gurumoorthy and Dr.Asitava Ghosal Aug 2012 - Dec 2012<br />
    This is a course project for the course Computer Aided Product Design. This project is aimed at designing<br />
    a snake like robot to be used for endoscopy and actuated by shape memory alloy (SMA) wires. The final<br />
    design incorporated links connected by -a ball joint in the form of contacting surfaces and relatively actuated<br />
    by SMA wires. The unique capability of the product is the better control exerted over the entire length of the<br />
    endoscope as compared to a conventional endoscope.<br />
    Skills/Learning: Working principles of SMA wire and actuation mechanisms, mechanism design.<br />
    Design and analysis of two arm thermal actuators for MEMS applications.<br />
    Guided by Dr. P. K. Patowari Aug 2009 - June 2010<br />
    This is the dissertation project for undergraduation in mechanical engineering from National Institute of<br />
    Technology Silchar.<br />
    This project considers a two arm monometallic horizontal thermal actuator as a basic model (Model I)<br />
    for design and analysis. In this process, the actuator modelling is first done and then the analysis for the<br />
    deflection, stress developed, temperature attained by the actuator is carried out by applying different voltages.<br />
    Three materials, namely Silicon, Poly-Silicon and Titanium, are considered for analysis. The three<br />
    materials show different variations at different applied voltages. Then two other models, Model II and Model<br />
    III are introduced. Model II has arms with varying lengths and Model III has the same geometry as the<br />
    basic model but is bimetallic. This project aims at finding the suitability of the materials and configuration of<br />
    thermal actuators for their applications with respect to applied voltage.<br />
    Model I, using Poly-Si, is again analyzed for varying lengths and cross sections of the arms. Then for calculating<br />
    the output force a theoretical method is proposed using the analogy of point load deflection of a<br />
    cantilever. The relation between output force and deflection of the actuator is analyzed. Next, using the basic<br />
    model an array is modelled and analyzed for deflection for number of actuators in the array and applied<br />
    voltage. In terms of application, a mechanism for rotation of a micro ratchet is proposed using two actuators<br />
    of the basic model in place of a V-beam actuator.<br />
    Skills/Learning: Exposure to MEMS and multiphysics systems, simulation of multiphysics systems in Comsol,<br />
    technical writing.<br />
